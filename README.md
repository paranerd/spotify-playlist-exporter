# Spotify Playlist Exporter

Export playlist tracks to CSV.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Client ID and Client Secret for the Spotify API
2. Set `http://127.0.0.1:9090` as Redirect URL

## Usage

1. When prompted by the script, open the displayed URL in a browser
2. Grant access to your Spotify library
3. The redirection will fail (that's expected)
4. Copy the redirection URL and paste it back to the script (it will parse the code from it to continue)
